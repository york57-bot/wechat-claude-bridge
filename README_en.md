Scan a QR code to bind your WeChat, and a new "friend" appears in your contacts. Send it a message — it gets forwarded to Claude Code running on your computer, and the reply streams back to WeChat in real time. Supports text, images, voice, and files.

## Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| **Scan and go** | No account signup, no server deployment. Scan a QR code and you're done in a minute. All data stays on your machine. |
| **Clean messages** | Only key info gets pushed — progress, results, key decisions. Tool calls and intermediate noise are filtered out automatically. |
| **"Typing..." indicator** | WeChat shows a typing indicator while Claude is working, so you always know it's on it. |
| **Consistent experience** | Mobile and desktop Claude Code behave identically — same orchestration, same output. Not two disconnected AIs. |
| **Two-way files** | Send images, Word docs, PDFs for Claude to analyze. Files Claude generates get pushed directly to WeChat — no need to go back to your computer. |
| **Timeout reassurance** | Task taking longer than 5 minutes? You'll get an automatic message letting you know it's still working. |

## Install

**Option 1: skills CLI (recommended)**

```bash
npx skills add Wechat-ggGitHub/wechat-claude-code
```

The first time you trigger the skill, it will automatically clone the source and install dependencies.

**Option 2: Manual clone**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wechat-ggGitHub/wechat-claude-code.git ~/.claude/skills/wechat-claude-code
cd ~/.claude/skills/wechat-claude-code && npm install
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Bind WeChat

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/wechat-claude-code
npm run setup
```

A QR code will pop up — scan it with WeChat.

### 2. Start the service

```bash
npm run daemon -- start
```

On macOS, this registers a launchd agent for auto-start on boot and auto-restart on crash.

### 3. Start chatting

Open WeChat and send a message to your new "friend".

### Manage the service

```bash
npm run daemon -- status   # Check if running
npm run daemon -- stop     # Stop the service
npm run daemon -- restart  # Restart (after code updates)
npm run daemon -- logs     # View recent logs
```

## WeChat Commands

Send these directly in the WeChat chat:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/clear` | Clear current session, start fresh |
| `/stop` | Stop current task |
| `/model <name>` | Switch Claude model |
| `/prompt <text>` | Set a system prompt (e.g. "reply in Chinese") |
| `/cwd <path>` | Switch working directory |
| `/skills` | List installed Skills |
| `/status` | View current session state |
| `/history [n]` | View recent chat history |
| `/compact` | Compact context, start a new CLI session |
| `/reset` | Full reset including working directory |
| `/undo [n]` | Remove last N messages from history |
| `/<skill> [args]` | Trigger any installed Skill |

## How It Works

```
WeChat (phone) ←→ ilink Bot API ←→ Node.js daemon ←→ Claude Code CLI (local)
```

The daemon long-polls WeChat for new messages, forwards them to the local `claude` CLI, and streams replies back to WeChat. Everything runs on your own machine.

---

## Roadmap

- **Message queue optimization** — Consecutive messages can produce mixed-up replies. Working on a better queuing strategy. Ideas welcome.
- **Prevent sleep** — Use macOS `caffeinate` to keep the system awake, so closing the lid doesn't interrupt the service.
- **Resume desktop session** — Chat on your computer for a while, then continue the same session from WeChat on the go. Same workspace, same context.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- macOS or Linux
- A personal WeChat account
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed and authenticated

> **Note:** Claude Code supports third-party API providers (OpenRouter, AWS Bedrock, etc.) — set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` accordingly.
